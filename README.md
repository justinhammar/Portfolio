### Text-based Adventure  
**CS 165 - Accelerated Intro to Computer Science**  
**August 2014**  
This is a simple text-based adventure.  In it, you can do many basic text-based adventure activities, like go from room to room, examine items, take and drop items, use items, save and load save files, and more.  The focus was on making the underlying engine as modular and extensible as I could manage, so adding more rooms, placing more items in rooms, and even adding entirely new items is relatively painless.

### Virtual Piano  
**Professional Enrichment Project**  
**June 2010**  
This is a virtual piano like one you might see in Garage Band.  By pressing the coresponding computer keys or by clicking on the GUI keys with the mouse, appropriate MIDI sounds are generated.  The keys also get visually highlighted when they are played.
