### Text-based Adventure  
**CS 165 - Accelerated Intro to Computer Science**

This is a simple text-based adventure.  In it, you can do many basic text-based adventure activities, like go from room to room, examine items, take and drop items, use items, save and load save files, and more.  The focus was on making the underlying engine as modular and extensible as I could manage, so adding more rooms, placing more items in rooms, and even adding entirely new items is relatively painless.
